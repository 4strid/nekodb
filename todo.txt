FEATURES:
* Actually support MongoDB
- Add remaining database methods
- Typeclass validators should return promises (... this would basically require a complete rewrite)
- More relationships: backreferences etc.
- Traps (hooks)
- model.join() -- resolves all references to their actual documents
* support cursor
- namespacing
- supply a filepath to specify where to stick the db files for nedb

CODE HEALTH:
- consistently use arrow functions
- add more tests
- type checking when registering models and validators
- jsdoc comments
- update README
- rewrite the whole thing now that we have a better understanding of what all the pieces need to do

EVENTUALLY:
- migrations
- realtime
